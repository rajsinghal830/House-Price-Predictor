# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Beginner's Notebook

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning notebook that predicts house prices based on a dataset of housing features. It is built using Python and demonstrates the full ML workflow: data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Predicts the final sale price of homes using 79 features describing different aspects of residential properties.
- Applies machine learning models such as **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **Linear Regression**.
- Includes:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Feature encoding and transformation
  - Model evaluation using RMSE and R² score

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is from the [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

- `train.csv` — training data with target prices
- `test.csv` — test data for final predictions

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**
